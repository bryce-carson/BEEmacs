# BEEmacs

BEEmacs (Browser-based Experimental Editor Macros (but not Emacs in the browser)) is a collection of code and people that aims to understand, study, and implement text-oriented applications in the browser. Nicolas Rougier's _[On the design of text editors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06030.pdf)_ is an interesting read which may be helpful to consider carefully.

Several projects already leverage web technologies to create powerful applications, namely: [RStudio](rstudio.com), and [Vim.wasm](https://github.com/rhysd/vim.wasm).

## Suggestions for Inspiration

- Try RStudio Cloud (uses the Ace Editor)
- Try Emacs with Spacemacs or Doom (Emacs editor)
- Try Vim (Vim editor)
- Try Vim.wasm (Vim in the browser using wasm)
